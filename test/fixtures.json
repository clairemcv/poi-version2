     "description":"A rocky landing at the best of times, conveniently placed for a pitstop on a trip up or down the Barrow, the Nore, or the Suir. Situated river right at the tight bend where the Suir almost becomes the sea. At LW keep away from the little harbour, the whole area round which is very silted."

     "description":"This Gaeltacht island is truly the Land’s End of SW Ireland. Mountainous, steep, and imposing, the island is home in winter to about 135 people or 110 voters and many more in summer. A ferry runs all year from Baltimore – twice daily in winter, more often in summer. In summer, there is also a ferry from Schull. The island has pubs, B&Bs, restaurants, two hostels, a well-appointed campsite, windmills, very basic shops and provisions, and the most famous bird observatory in the country. The co-operative club serves excellent meals and drink on the harbour, and Cotter’s Bar is also located here. There is a third wee pub up at the waist. A fourth, modern pub, Danny Mike’s, has been built just S of the waist, and excellent food may be had from breakfast to dinner time."

     "name": "Great Saltee Island",
     "location": "Wexford",
     "description":"This is a beautiful island. Grazed and easily walked or camped on, this island is lovely and deservedly popular with Irish paddlers. The island is a famed bird-watching spot, and is often inhabited by birding visitors in season, mainly spring and autumn. Once inhabited by 20 people, the island became uninhabited relatively early by Irish island standards. There are monuments and references to Prince Michael of Saltee on the island. He bought the island in 1943, crowned himself Prince in 1972, and died in 1998."
